    <p class="intro">A Lovely Letter Just for You</p>
    <p>My dearest love,</p>
    <p>
        There are days when I feel like I’m not even worthy of the love you give me, and yet, you continue to fill my heart with more than I ever dreamed possible. You are everything I could have ever asked for and more. Even with your crazy mood swings and moments when everything feels a little out of balance. I still love you sooooo so muchhh, more than I ever thought I could love anyone.   </p>
    <p>
        Yes, you can be mad at me, yes, we have our ups and downs, but nothing, absolutely nothing, will change the fact that I love you with every ounce of my being. Sometimes, I even think that your anger and those little storms are just a part of the magic that makes you, you that's the Nikki I know, incredibly strong, wonderfully you. And even when you’re mad or upset, I still want us to be together, because even in those moments, I know we’re stronger together.    </p>
    <p>
        But do you remember, my love, July 10, 2024? The day you said yes to me? I swear, that moment was the happiest day of my life. Everything just clicked. That was the day my world shifted, the day I knew without a doubt that I had found my forever. I’ll never forget the way my heart raced when you said those words, how every doubt I’d ever had about love just melted away. You said yes, and in that moment, I knew I’d found my solace in you.
        </p>
    <p>
        I hope you know, with every beat of my heart, that I want to stay by your side for as long as you'll have me. I’ll be here, patiently loving you through all the storms, holding your hand through the sunny days and the cloudy ones. I will love you in every season of life, no matter the mood, no matter the moment. You are my heart, my soul, my forever.
    </p>
    <p>
        So please, bear with me, my love. Through every laugh, every tear, every argument, and every quiet moments we share. I’ll stay with you. Always.
    </p>
      Forever yours,<br>
